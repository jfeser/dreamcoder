"""
Tests for clevrPrimitives.py | Author: Catherine Wong
Tests for the CLEVR Python implementations of primitives.

All tests are manually added to a 'test_all' function.

"""

# TODO: see enumeration.py for the functionality to call a single OCaml task.

# TODO: see CLEVR test -- may be able to substitute in a special task.specialSolver to use the test functions, and pass in the raw program directly.

# TODO: must try for better error handling in OCaml.

# TODO: test existing primitives, then switch to actual Object types in CLEVR.
